# pure_php_templates

This isn't a ready-to-use library but rather a concept of native php templates with:
- transparent string escaping
- ability to "include" other templates
- conditions and loops support

PHP 8+ is required (it is not strictly necessary, but named arguments makes code much easier to write and understand).
